# SNA-for-job-descriptions
Social Network Analysis (SNA) examines social structures using networks and graph theory. It studies the relationships and interactions among individuals, groups, or organizations to understand social behavior, dynamics, and structures. SNA represents entities as nodes and their relationships as edges. By analyzing centrality measures, community detection, clustering coefficients, and structural holes, SNA uncovers patterns, identifies influential nodes, and reveals the underlying structure of social networks. It finds applications across disciplines like sociology, anthropology, psychology, and marketing, providing insights into social influence, information diffusion, collaboration patterns, and organizational structures.


In this instance, we'll employ Social Network Analysis (SNA) to analyze job descriptions.
